Telemetry.js
=========

Simple tools for adding telemetry to javascript applications.

Supports Google Analytics Timing API by default (just include GA in the page before loading this library), as well as posting to whatever logging backend you want. 

Depends on jQuery, but that can be easily replaced with any xhr library.
